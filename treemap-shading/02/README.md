A treemap of counties by state. Counties are colored in green if they grew from 2010 to 2014 and shades of red if they shrunk in that same period.  

On mouseover, all counties in the moused-over county's parent state are shaded by their population growth rate, on a color scale ranging from:

+ the minimum growth rate for the state to 0 (for the "red" counties that lost population)

+ 0 to the maximum growth rate for the state (for the "green" counties whose population grew)

An iteration on the bl.ock [Treemap](http://bl.ocks.org/emeeks/98f56f3e840143a4eccf/bb68d0c26f6105ec0e71c76d4fe296daca5eaccf) from [emeeks](http://bl.ocks.org/emeeks)

To improve on [County Treemap I](http://bl.ocks.org/micahstubbs/c5f71b45dbd87402e6f2), this treemap uses a color scale for each state, which results in bolder colors that better showcase the variation in county population growth rates within each state.  Like [County Treemap I](http://bl.ocks.org/micahstubbs/c5f71b45dbd87402e6f2), this treemap only shows one gradient color scale at once to ensure we suggest valid comparisons to the user.
