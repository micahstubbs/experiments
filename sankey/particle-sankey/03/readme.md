Original `README.md`:

Using particles to indicate flow between reservoirs in a sankey diagram. This time with particles moving at varying speeds and maintaining the color of the source node. You can drag the reservoirs (the rectangles) to adjust the path of the flows.

Other examples of sankeys with particles:

* [Fixed speed particles transitioning in color from source node color to target node color.](http://bl.ocks.org/emeeks/9673c96a682fe3948379)

* [Particles of differing sizes and differing speeds moving in "bursts" between nodes.](http://bl.ocks.org/emeeks/21f99959d48dd0d0c746)
