Trying to develop some intution for hexagon placement, and perhaps re-discover some trigonometry along the way.

for loops and conditionals?! I know.  hopefully more compact representations will present themselves in future iterations.

hexagon path generating function from [http://www.thelow.co.uk/?p=128](http://www.thelow.co.uk/?p=128)

motivation from the bl.ocks [hexbin with no axes](http://bl.ocks.org/micahstubbs/4ee4c58c9dfc2a41ed26) and [Fog of War III](http://bl.ocks.org/emeeks/f0f96f11c7d1afceaeb3), which stubbornly resisted quick modification
