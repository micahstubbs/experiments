## hexbin scatterplot

a [d3.hexbin()](https://github.com/d3/d3-plugins/tree/master/hexbin) example with no axes for [xaranke](http://bl.ocks.org/xaranke)

this example modifies the block [Hexagonal Binning](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4248145) by

+ removing the axes

+ removing the stroke from the hexagon paths

This example shows how to use the [d3.hexbin](https://github.com/d3/d3-plugins/tree/master/hexbin) plugin for hexagonal binning. 2,000 random points with a normal distribution are binned into hexagons; color encodes the number of points that fall into each bin. You can also use [area encoding](../4248146). Inspired by earlier work by [Zachary Forest Johnson](http://indiemaps.com/blog/2011/10/hexbins/).
