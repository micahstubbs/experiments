add a legend, with a new dataset!

an iteration on the bl.ock [radar chart for nested data](http://bl.ocks.org/micahstubbs/44bb05aab218a40a4c12) by [@micahstubbs](http://bl.ocks.org/micahstubbs)

and a further iteration on the bl.ock [Radar Chart Redesign](http://bl.ocks.org/nbremer/21746a9668ffdf6d8242) created by [@nbremer](http://bl.ocks.org/nbremer)

the data is a subset of [table 7-8: Correct answers to factual knowledge questions in physical and biological sciences, by country/region: Most recent year](http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind14/index.cfm/etc/tables.htm#chp7) from the US National Science Foundation
