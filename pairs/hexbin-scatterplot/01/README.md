This example shows how to use the [d3.hexbin](https://github.com/d3/d3-plugins/tree/master/hexbin) plugin for hexagonal binning. 2,000 random points with a normal distribution are binned into hexagons; color encodes the number of points that fall into each bin. You can also use [area encoding](../4248146). Inspired by earlier work by [Zachary Forest Johnson](http://indiemaps.com/blog/2011/10/hexbins/).
