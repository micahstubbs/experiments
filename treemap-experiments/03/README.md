a treemap prototype where the 

+ area of the cell 
+ the maxArea of all the cells that share the same depth and same parent with that cell

is used to scale the color on an colorscale that ranges from the current categorical color for the top hierarchy level to lightgray.

this is difficult.  should likely edit the treemap layout directly to produce a order property for each of the nested parent objects.

Work in progress.
