a treemap prototype where the 

+ area of the cell 
+ the maxArea of all the cells that share the same depth and same parent with that cell

is used to scale the color on an orange to lightgray colorscale.

in this prototype we set the sort property of the treemap2 layout to position the largest area cell in the top-right of the group.
