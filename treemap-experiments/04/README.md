a treemap prototype where the 

+ area of the cell 
+ the maxArea of all the cells that share the same depth and same parent with that cell

is used to scale the color on an orange to lightgray colorscale.

in this prototype we use a new treemap2 layout to calculate the maxArea property and add it to each node object.
