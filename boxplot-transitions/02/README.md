A box-and-whisker plot uses simple glyphs that summarize a quantitative distribution with five standard statistics: the smallest value, lower quartile, median, upper quartile, and largest value. This summary approach allows the viewer to easily recognize differences between distributions. Data from the [Michelson–Morley experiment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelson–Morley_experiment). Implementation contributed by [Jason Davies](http://www.jasondavies.com/). This example periodically randomizes the values to demonstrate transitions.
